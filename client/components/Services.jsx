          <p>The services and their locations listed below are those  which we regularly have on Sundays. The exception to this is when there is a  month with a 5th Sunday where the parish combines at St Paulâ€™s to  have one service of worship. Prayer lies at the heart of the parish life. It  holds everything together and it sustains every other activity. Faith is centred on Christ and the Gospel. Without Christ nothing makes sense; with Christ all things are possible.</p>
