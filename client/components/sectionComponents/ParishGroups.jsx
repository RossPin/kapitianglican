          <h2>Parish Groups</h2>
          <p>There are many groups operating within the parish on a regular basis and there are many ways for people to be able to contribute to the mission and the ministry of the parish, the giving of 'Talents, Time and Treasure'.</p>
          <p><strong>"Everyone has a place and a ministry"</strong></p>
          <p>The groups reflect a multigenerational, multicultural parish. All people of all age groups are important and essential to the life of the parish. The nurturing of our young people is a responsibility of the greatest importance.</p>
