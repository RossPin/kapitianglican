          <h2>Food Co-op</h2>
          <p>In 2019 Kapiti Anglicans took up the coordinating and hosting of the Kapiti fruit and vege Coop. the Coop is a partnership between the  church, the local community, Wellington Regional Public Health and Wesley community action to get cheap good quality fruit and veges into local communities and particularly into the households of  those on low incomes. We are thrilled to be involved in this initiative aimed at flourishing the least in our community. The Coop has many church and community volunteers working side by side to achieve the aims of the Coop. All profits are used to serve the community by agreement with coop members and in 2020 during lockdown we began regular supply of potatoes for the local foodbank and fruit and vege packs to two local schools. Coordinator- Christine Bull.</p>
