          <p><strong>Home groups and house churches-</strong> Kapiti Parish boasts a good number of home groups and house churches where parishioners meet in smaller groups for encouragement, prayer, Bible Study and reflection. Most groups meet weekly and we often have extra groups running through Lent. Kathleen Fleck is the co-ordinator. Contact the office for details.</p>
          <p><strong>Men’s and Women’s Fellowship Groups Marksmen-</strong> a men’s group that meets monthly on the   Monday of the month in the Parish Lounge for a meal and to listen to a speaker on a topical issue. Newcomers are most welcome. Contact office for details.</p>
