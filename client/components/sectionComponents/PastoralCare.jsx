          <h2>Pastoral Care</h2>
          <p>Pastoral care happens all over the parish by congregation members one to another and to neighbours, and through our Small Group network, but sometimes there are particular pastoral needs that we need a coordinated approach to such as; transition from home to resthome care, sickness or hospitalisation, increasing frailty, family difficulties, bereavements, anxiety. In such cases we urge you to contact the priest responsible for your congregation, or Reverend Lynda Wards so we can ensure adequate support in these challenging times.</p>
