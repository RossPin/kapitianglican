          <h2>Rest Home Ministry</h2>
          <p>We have a strong team of volunteers  who go into  8 of our local resthomes and retirement villages(Eldon Lodge, Kapiti Resthome, Coastal villas (3), Summerset, Midland gardens, Kena Kena, Sevenoaks (2), Millvale lodge (2)) to lead services and care for the spiritual needs of the homes and villages. These services are greatly appreciated by residents and carers and requests to pray or minister in other ways are often received by members of these teams. We are always looking for more volunteers to support this ministry. If you think this may be for you contact Kathleen Fleck via the office.</p>
