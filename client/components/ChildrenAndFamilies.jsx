          <h2>Children and Families Ministry</h2>
          <h3>Sundays</h3>
          <p>Family is important - no matter how many people there are! We love to include kids, and adults, in worship at all our venues each Sunday. Whether your style is energetic, easy-going, expressive, or enquiring, you are welcome among us. During school term time, we offer kid’s sessions at our Raumati and Paraparaumu venues each Sunday morning, plus an All-In worship service each month, when everyone mixes together during worship: we love the joy and fun that creates!</p>
          <h3>4+More</h3>
          <p>Inspiring, Developing and  Educating children aged 4 and up is part of our DNA at Kāpiti Anglicans. Did we mention fun? That too! Christian Values? Definitely. Come see what 4+More is all about each Wednesday 3:30pm-5pm during school term time, at the Hall, 1 Langdale Road, Paraparaumu. Talk to Rev. Fee for even more info.</p>
          <h3>In-School Support</h3>
          <p>We assist two Kāpiti schools with our Fruit and Veggie Co-op, and Rev. Fee - our Families and Children’s Minister - gives a fair chunk of her time as Chaplain for Paraparaumu School, supporting students, families, and school staff, which we are super excited about! There’s a place for you to help on this growing team - whether you’ve got green thumbs for our Gardening Club, floury fingers for our Baking crew, or just want to give a little listening time - our Tamariki deserve support from each of us; what we can offer, and do, today makes such a difference in our young one’s lives.</p>
          <h3>New Baby? Thinking about a Ceremony?</h3>
          <p>Want to celebrate the gift of a child’s life in a special way? Baptism, Naming Day, Blessing service, Thanksgiving for the gift of a Child? We can help you hold the right ceremony for your child, or celebrate a significant step in their life journey. Rev. Fee, or one of our other ministers, are here to help you and your child as you renew significant traditions, or create new ones for your family!</p>
